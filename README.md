_a postmodern excuse generator for the modern world_

_run_ ```python manage.py runserver``` _in the main folder, then visit your_ ```localhost:8000``` _to begin_

_find our official submission page [here](http://devpost.com/software/lately)_

### the problem
In general, people are **statistically insignificant**. Billions of lives are nothing but **empty puppets**, buffeted by the torrential winds of chaos as major events are generated by the decisions of mother nature and the powerful few. As the years pass, the struggle to maintain the delusion of control becomes exhausting and, after some soul-seeking, decidedly pointless. You spend an hour too long **wallowing in psychophilosophical self-pity** and now you're late for work.

### where we come in
Why not embrace the inevitable chaos the world offers and secede your dearest possession, i.e. your professional image, to the inscrutable wisdom of the random number generator? Simply **log on to our service** with your Microsoft Outlook account, and our **AI algorithm** will construct a **semi-coherent message**excusing your temporary absence. But that's not all:

- you **never get to see the email** we send for you, because just like the TPP, higher forces in our universe **don't care** whether you're in the know or not.
- just to make sure there's **no funny business**, the message we send **won't show up in your "sent" folder** either.

* Sorry for being late, I was forgiving the sins of my priest. 
* Sorry for being late, I was Netflix and Chilling with my mother's grandson.
* Sorry for being late, I was aggressively examining my partner's muscle spasms or intense jazz hands, I cannot tell.

### happy customers
“What exactly is postmodernism, except modernism without the anxiety?”
_Jonathan Lethem_

“Nothing exists; even if something exists, nothing can be known about it; and even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it can't be communicated to others.” 
_Gorgias_

“There are no hard distinctions between what is real and what is unreal, nor between what is true and what is false. A thing is not necessarily either true or false; it can be both true and false.” 
_Harold Pinter_

“The Postmodernists' tyranny wears people down by boredom and semi-literate prose.” 
_Christopher Hitchens_
